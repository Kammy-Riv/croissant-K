    <h1>🥐Croissants</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a type of pastry, classically made with puff pastry dough so
    that it is light, flaky, and extremely buttery. Traditionally, croissants
    are formed into crescent shapes, which is probably where the name
    originated, since croissant means “crescent” in French. The pastries are
    extremely popular in France as well as in other nations, and are typically
    eaten with breakfast. In some cases, croissants may also be filled with
    sweet or savory ingredient, or used like bread to make croissant sandwiches.</p>
